## Introduction

### Purpose

We here at APEEYE have been playing around with the hapi.js framework (https://hapijs.com/) for a while now, and absolutely love it. Kudoes to the <a href="https://github.com/orgs/hapijs/people">hapi.js team</a> We set out to create a Hapi template, with some basic features baked into the template, making use of various plugins provided by the community. 

Disclaimer: This template was created by novice developers. We are not claiming this is the absolute best template setup there possibly could be, so feel free to constructively critique it and make suggestions on how to improve it.
